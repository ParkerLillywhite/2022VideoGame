            "I don't understand. where did they all go? why did they all leave me? I don't understand. They were my closest friends they wouldn't just leave me like this. why? there's no trace of them leaving. No footprints. I hear sounds in the night. distant warping, cannon-like sounds. sometimes Ten, Twenty times a night, sometimes more. I think I'm going to die here. We thought we'd all be rescued but now I'm all alone. Did they see me as a burden? All I can think of now is those sounds. They reverberate off of the cliffside to the (east) of our camp. That's how I know I'm not crazy. It's all real. But all I do is stare into the forest. I stare so intently waiting for something to move. Then something does.";
        ShortStory_02 = 
            "I swear to God I saw someone, I saw him staring at me. way out into the forest where the trees start to mesh together. I called but I got no answer. I had kept quiet for so long it felt as if every hidden creature in the forest was now staring at me. They were waiting for me to break. All the invisible eyes now locked on me were ready to make their move. It's strange how little wildlife there is here too, I hear the blood rushing around my ears more than I do anything else. The more I try to focus, the more of my own body I start to hear. Tendons creaking, bones grinding. This is it. The silence is too much. They all left me behind because they knew what was stalking me. I yelled out again. I HEAR YOU! a twig snapped. ----- I think the relief of tension triggered something in my brain. I think I am hallucinating now. a dishevelled figure made itself known walking from one tree to another. not limping, but dragging itself forward like a reanimated corpse. It lifted it's skull to the sky shreiking - 'Don't come near'. it collapsed onto it's knees then completely to the ground. I turn my head and it's gone. I've lost my mind. I swear to God I saw it though... More strange cannon fire.";
        ShortStory_03 =
            "Moving to the beach has been good for me. I wonder if this is where they went? I think sometimes that I'll run into them while walking along the coastline. Atleast the noise is occupied - lots of waves and wind. plenty of fish too. Yesterday I made a trek to our boat. Every immaginable thing onboard was gone. ";
